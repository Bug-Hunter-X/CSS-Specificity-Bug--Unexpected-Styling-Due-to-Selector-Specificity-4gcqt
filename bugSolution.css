The following solution fixes the issue by either reorganizing the CSS rules or using more specific selectors as needed to ensure that the correct style is applied.

**Solution 1: Reordering CSS rules** 
Place the more specific selector later in your stylesheet.   While it's usually better to make sure your selectors are unambiguous, putting the most specific selector later sometimes suffices:

```css
.item {
  color: blue;
}

.container {
  width: 200px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.container .item {
  color: red;
}
```

**Solution 2: Using more specific or more unambiguous selectors**
This is the preferred solution, and it avoids ambiguity by using classes that are more distinct from one another.  For instance, if it was intentional that items in the container are red, you might instead make your stylesheet more precise:

```css
.item {
  color: blue;
}

.container {
  width: 200px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.container .item-red {
  color: red;
}
```
This solution demonstrates improved code clarity and maintainability by avoiding the use of unintentionally conflicting selectors.
