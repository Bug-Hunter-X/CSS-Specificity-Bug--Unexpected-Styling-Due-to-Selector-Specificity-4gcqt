The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue where the specificity of selectors leads to unexpected behavior.  The rule with the more specific selector (`.container .item`) overrides the rule with the less specific selector (`.item`).  This can happen when you're not carefully considering the order of your CSS rules and selector specificity.

```css
.item {
  color: blue;
}

.container .item {
  color: red;
}

.container {
  width: 200px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

This results in all items within a container being red instead of blue.  However, items outside a container will correctly be blue.
